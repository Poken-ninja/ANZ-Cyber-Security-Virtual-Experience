## 🎯 What is Phishing?

> Phishing is when someone tries to fraudulently obtain your personal information or login credentials through messages that appear to be from trusted sources.

These messages usually:
- Pretend to be from a known institution (like a bank)
- Ask you to **click a link**
- Then prompt you to enter sensitive data (like passwords or card numbers)
