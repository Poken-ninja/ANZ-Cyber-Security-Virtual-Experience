These were the questions i was asked Sub-task 1: 

•	anz-logo.jpg and bank-card.jpg are two images that show up in the users network traffic.
•	Extract these images from the pcap file and attach them to your report.

Sub-task 2: 

•	The network traffic for the images "ANZ1.jpg" and "ANZ2.jpg" is more than it appears.
•	Extract the images, include them and mention what is different about them in your report.

Sub-task 3: 

•	The user downloaded a suspicious document called "how-to-commit-crimes.docx"
•	Find the contents of this file and include it in your report.

Sub-task 4: 

•	The user accessed 3 pdf documents: ANZ_Document.pdf, ANZ_Document2.pdf, evil.pdf
•	Extract and view these documents. Include images of them in your report.

Sub-task 5: 

•	The user also accessed a file called "hiddenmessage2.txt"
•	What is the contents of this file? Include it in your report

Sub-task 6: 

•	The user accessed an image called "atm-image.jpg"
•	Identify what is different about this traffic and include everything in your report.

Sub-task 7: 

•	The network traffic shows that the user accessed the image "broken.png"

These were the analysis i made :
Sub-task 1: 

•	anz-logo.jpg and bank-card.jpg are two images that show up in the users network traffic.
•	Extract these images from the pcap file and attach them to your report.

Image Extraction from PCAP File
Objective
To identify and extract two image files, anz-logo.jpg and bank-card.jpg, observed in the user’s network traffic captured within the PCAP file.

Methodology
1.	The PCAP file was opened using Wireshark.
2.	An HTTP filter (http) was applied to isolate relevant traffic.
3.	Via File → Export Objects → HTTP, all HTTP-transferred files were reviewed.
4.	Both anz-logo.jpg and bank-card.jpg were identified in the export list.
5.	Each image was individually extracted and saved locally.
6.	The file headers were reviewed to verify JPEG format signatures (FF D8 FF).

Findings
•	anz-logo.jpg: Successfully extracted. Displays a corporate logo consistent with phishing themes.
•	bank-card.jpg: Successfully extracted. Appears to depict sensitive financial data, likely used for social engineering or credential theft.

Attachments
  

Sub-task 2: 

•	The network traffic for the images "ANZ1.jpg" and "ANZ2.jpg" is more than it appears.
•	Extract the images, include them and mention what is different about them in your report.

Obj:To examine network-captured images for signs of hidden data or anomalies, based on file size irregularities and hexadecimal patterns in the PCAP traffic.

1. Image Extraction from PCAP:
Using Wireshark, the files ANZ1.jpg and ANZ2.jpg were reconstructed from captured network traffic by locating JPEG file signatures:
•	Start of Image (SOI): FFD8
•	End of Image (EOI): FFD9
Upon inspection of raw hexadecimal data streams:
•	Multiple instances of FFD8 and FFD9 markers were observed in both images.
•	This strongly suggests that additional JPEG segments or payloads are embedded within the same file boundary.

2. Security Implications:
•	The presence of multiple JPEG segments within a single .jpg file is not standard behavior.
•	Both ANZ1.jpg and ANZ2.jpg appear legitimate at first glance but contain multiple image headers and footers, indicating embedded or hidden content.
This technique is consistent with methods used in covert communication, malware smuggling, or cybersecurity awareness challenge scenarios.
Further investigation using binary extraction and steganographic analysis is strongly recommended.
  

Sub-task 3: 

•	The user downloaded a suspicious document called "how-to-commit-crimes.docx"
•	Find the contents of this file and include it in your report.

Incident Report: Suspicious Document Analysis
Artifact Name:
how-to-commit-crimes.docx
Detection Method:
Manual inspection via Wireshark (HTTP traffic analysis)
Date/Time of Observation:
Fri, 16 Aug 2019

1. Summary
A suspicious file named how-to-commit-crimes.docx was observed being transferred over HTTP. Despite its .docx extension indicating a Microsoft Word document, content analysis revealed it to be a plain text file with potentially malicious intent.
  
This is a suspicious document.

2. Security Assessment
•	The file is not a valid .docx and is instead a plain-text document disguised with a .docx extension.
•	Contains language suggesting intent to guide or simulate criminal behavior, specifically unauthorized system access (“Hack them”).
•	Its transmission over plain HTTP with no encryption increases its visibility and suggests a lack of secure data handling.

3. Recommendations
•	Flag the file as malicious or deceptive in your incident response system.
•	Block further access to the URL/path /how-to-commit-crimes.docx on the web server.
•	Investigate source and destination IPs to determine if this was part of a broader campaign.
•	Archive the artifact for forensic records and signature creation.
•	Review server and endpoint logs for similar filename or activity patterns.


Sub-task 4: 

•	The user accessed 3 pdf documents: ANZ_Document.pdf, ANZ_Document2.pdf, evil.pdf
•	Extract and view these documents. Include images of them in your report.


Sub-task 5: 

•	The user also accessed a file called "hiddenmessage2.txt"
•	What is the contents of this file? Include it in your report

Sub-task 5: Analysis of hiddenmessage2.txt
File Accessed
•	Filename: hiddenmessage2.txt
•	Request Method: HTTP GET
Extracted Image
After isolating the JPEG binary content between the SOI and EOI markers, the image was successfully extracted. The recovered image is shown below:
Description of Image:
The image shows three cartoon-styled people (two women and one man) standing in a modern office setting with the ANZ Bank logo in the background. The setting and style suggest this may be part of a cybersecurity awareness campaign.
Security Significance
This tactic—embedding image data in a text file—is a form of content obfuscation. It can be used to:
•	Bypass security filters or casual inspection
•	Smuggle multimedia content into seemingly harmless file formats
•	Implement primitive steganography or covert messaging
From a digital forensics standpoint, this technique may indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or conceal malicious content. This reinforces the importance of examining content beyond declared MIME types.
 

Sub-task 6: 

•	The user accessed an image called "atm-image.jpg"
•	Identify what is different about this traffic and include everything in your report.

Analysis of atm-image.jpg
File Details:
•	Filename: atm-image.jpg
•	Access Method: HTTP GET request
•	Signature Detected: JFIF (indicating valid JPEG structure)
•	Header and Footer: Starts with FFD8 and ends with FFD9 – confirms complete JPEG image
Visual Description:
•	The image displays two ANZ-branded ATM machines placed side-by-side in what appears to be a bank branch or ATM kiosk environment.
•	The design is minimalistic and animated/cartoon-style—indicating that this image is likely part of an awareness campaign or internal training material.
Threat Assessment:
•	No indicators of compromise were found.
•	The image does not exhibit any suspicious behavior or contain hidden data (based on header/footer inspection and content context).
•	However, it is still best practice to run this file through tools like exiftool, binwalk, or stegsolve if time permits, to ensure complete validation.
Conclusion:
The file atm-image.jpg is a clean, low-resolution JPEG showing two ANZ ATM machines. It appears to be part of legitimate visual content delivered over HTTP. No signs of tampering, embedded content, or malicious intent were identified.
 

Sub-task 7: 

•	The network traffic shows that the user accessed the image "broken.png"
•	Extract and include the image in your report.

Tried so much but I couldn’t find anything
Sub-task 8: 

•	The user accessed one more document called securepdf.pdf
•	Access this document include an image of the pdf in your report. Detail the steps to access it.

Conclusion:
The file securepdf.pdf:
•	Cannot be opened or validated as a legitimate PDF file.
•	Contains no renderable content or extractable structure.
•	Includes the following embedded message:
Password is "secure"
This string should be retained as it may be relevant to subsequent stages of the investigation.

I was unable to analyze task 4,7,8 and left out a small detail in task 6 sp i corrected my mistakes learned methods to analyze other tasks 
here are my final updates on these tasks:
Task 4:
In order to view these PDF’s I viewed the TCP stream as usual, and found the file signature for a PDF, which was the hex data “25 50 44 46”. I noticed in the ascii view that the PDF data went until the very end of the TCP stream, so I copied all the hex date from the file signature onwards into HxD and saved it as a pdf file.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ea6f6ec-ae5a-4ff6-bd1e-79e6358fa7bf)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ef7ac5a-9f0b-4844-8bff-533620248d2d)

Sub-task 6:
The second image:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb8d628-fd30-4e07-86ad-0e9b790741b2)
So the thing that is different about this traffic is that a single GET request performed by the user downloaded two images.

Sub-task 7: 

•	The network traffic shows that the user accessed the image "broken.png"
•	Extract and include the image in your report.

Tried so much but I couldn’t find anything
Ok after a lot of research I  got to know that the given png file when viewed in ascii format is showing something like  “”iVBORw0KGgo”” prefix which is typical for Base64-encoded image data in PNG format.

So now I have to copy the base64 one and go to an online converter to convert it into a png.
Starts with iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAA...”” ends with “...5ErkJggg==”
 

Sub-task 8: 

•	The user accessed one more document called securepdf.pdf
•	Access this document include an image of the pdf in your report. Detail the steps to access it.

If the stream starts with PK (50 4B 03 04)

So how did I know it wasn't a proper PDF?
When you looked at the TCP stream of the response, the data:
•	Didn’t begin with %PDF- (or 25 50 44 46 in hex)
•	Showed other characters like PK, JFIF, or plain ASCII text instead
•	Had incorrect or corrupted headers
•	Or showed signs of being ZIP or DOCX data (ZIP files start with 50 4B 03 04 → “PK”)
and goes on till the ned oof the file copy that as raw data paste into HxD and then search for pk using ctrl+f and then put it into new block and save it as zip then open zip extract files and opened the pdf
