Is this email safe or malicious?
Malicious

My Analysis:

The attached URL originates from Russia, which is suspicious for an internal or official ANZ communication.

The sender requests the recipient to download a file with a vague and generic justification, using terms such as “the report.”

The language and structure of the email are unprofessional. It lacks proper grammar, uses lowercase for "anz," and refers to a job title ("anz employee") without details.

The sender’s email address is not from a verified business domain.

There is a mismatch between the display name and the name used in the email body.

The email attempts to create urgency and fear by referencing potential job consequences and mentioning superiors. This is a common social engineering tactic used in phishing attempts.

Recommended Action:
Block the email, report the sender’s domain as suspicious, and educate users on recognizing urgency-based phishing emails.
