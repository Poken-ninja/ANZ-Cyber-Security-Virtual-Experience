📄 Email 1
Is this email safe or malicious?
Malicious

My Analysis:

The attached URL originates from Russia, which is suspicious for an internal or official ANZ communication.

The sender requests the recipient to download a file with a vague and generic justification, using terms such as “the report.”

The language and structure of the email are unprofessional. It lacks proper grammar, uses lowercase for "anz," and refers to a job title ("anz employee") without details.

The sender’s email address is not from a verified business domain.

There is a mismatch between the display name and the name used in the email body.

The email attempts to create urgency and fear by referencing potential job consequences and mentioning superiors. This is a common social engineering tactic used in phishing attempts.

Recommended Action:
Block the email, report the sender’s domain as suspicious, and educate users on recognizing urgency-based phishing emails.

📄 Email 1
Is this email safe or malicious?
Safe

My Analysis:

This is a casual email between friends discussing a video game (KSP2) and trailers from Games Con.

The sender's email domain is gmail.com, which aligns with the informal tone and content.

There are no links, no attachments, and no requests for login credentials or sensitive information.

No signs of phishing, social engineering, or urgency.

The language and structure are informal but appropriate for personal communication.

Recommended Action:
Release the email. No threats or red flags identified.

📄 Email 2
Is this email safe or malicious?
Malicious

My Analysis:

The sender's domain is venture.ru, which is unrelated to Microsoft or Office 365. This is highly suspicious.

The subject line and body try to mimic Microsoft/OneDrive notifications.

The message contains a link labeled “UPDATE YOUR ACCOUNT” which is likely to lead to a phishing page.

The email uses urgency by stating that an email update is required to continue receiving large files.

Mentions of “ADOBE PDF,” “Microsoft products,” and “SECURITY” are used as keywords to gain trust, but the grammar and formatting are unprofessional and inconsistent with official Microsoft communications.

Recommended Action:
Block the email and report the domain as phishing. Quarantine similar messages in the future.

📄 Email 3
Is this email safe or malicious?
Malicious

My Analysis:

The email contains a suspicious link that appears to imitate a Facebook login page. However, on closer inspection, the link is not legitimate:

The domain is: https://www.facebⓈook.com.opt/login.htm

It includes a typo-squatting trick: the second "b" in "facebook" is replaced with the special character "ß", which looks similar but changes the domain.

The domain ends in .opt, not .com — this is not a valid Facebook domain.

The sender (Vinny) creates a false sense of urgency and social trust by asking you to check if Facebook is down — a tactic used to lower your guard.

The message tries to exploit curiosity or helpfulness by asking the user to test a login — a common technique used to harvest credentials.

There are no other identifying or verifiable sender details — no domain signature, no official indicators.

Recommended Action:
Block the sender, flag the domain as phishing, and alert users about deceptive domains using look-alike characters.

📄 Email 4
Is this email safe or malicious?
Safe

My Analysis:

This email is a forwarded product advertisement for the "Drop + Koss GMR-54X-ISO Gaming Headset."

The content includes product details, images, ratings, and a "See More" button consistent with typical marketing emails.

The email does not request any sensitive information such as login credentials or financial details.

There are no suspicious attachments or misleading language.

The links and visuals appear to be product promotion and not attempts to deceive or trick the user.

While it is forwarded multiple times, there is no evidence of manipulation or phishing attempts.

The tone and formatting are consistent with legitimate commercial newsletters or product updates.

Recommended Action:
Release the email to the user’s inbox. It poses no threat.

📄 Email 5
Is this email safe or malicious?
Malicious

My Analysis:

The sender claims to be an FBI agent named Vincent stationed undercover in Uganda. This is an unlikely scenario and a common narrative used in scam emails.

The email attempts to create urgency and emotional appeal by referencing “critical Intel,” “local dictatorship,” and a failed mission, all intended to pressure the recipient.

It requests access to the recipient's email account to “send Intel,” which is a major red flag. Legitimate government or intelligence agencies do not request access to private citizens’ emails.

The email contains no verifiable credentials, no official FBI domain, and no secure or traceable contact method.

Phrases like “my W.A.E. email was burnt” and “local dictatorship blocks all emails” are vague, dramatic, and intended to convince someone with little technical knowledge.

The grammar and formatting are casual and inconsistent with how a real intelligence officer would communicate in a classified matter.

Recommended Action:
Block the sender immediately. Report the message as a phishing attempt. Alert users about scams impersonating government or law enforcement officials.

📄 Email 6
Is this email safe or malicious?
Safe

My Analysis:

The email exchange is between two known ANZ employees with official company email addresses (@anz.com).

The message content is typical of internal team collaboration, discussing project status, availability, file sharing, and informal catch-up.

No suspicious links, no requests for personal credentials, and no attachments are included at this stage.

Both the sender and recipient use official signatures with ANZ branding, roles, and physical addresses.

The conversation is contextually consistent and shows no signs of manipulation, spoofing, or social engineering attempts.

Recommended Action:
Release the email. It appears safe and appropriate for delivery to the intended recipient.

📄 Email 7
Is this email safe or malicious?
Malicious

My Analysis:

The email claims to offer a promotional deal for car insurance but is sent from a suspicious address: Val.kill.ma.

The message includes a malicious-looking URL: hxxp://iwhrhwicy.urlif.y/receipt.php, which uses:

"hxxp" instead of "http" – a tactic to bypass spam filters or avoid automatic detection.

A domain that is nonsensical and untrustworthy — not related to Geico or any known insurance provider.

There is no branding, no legitimate links, no context, and no personalization in the message.

The email uses clickbait-style subject lines to entice the recipient, a typical phishing tactic.

The overall structure, tone, and lack of company identification indicate a likely attempt to lure users into clicking a malicious link.

Recommended Action:
Block the sender, report the domain for phishing, and prevent similar messages from reaching users.
